The company has come a long way since 2007, when its co-founders first came up with the idea to invite paying guests to sleep on an air mattress in their living room....   This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values.\n",
        "the main goal of the analysis this data set is to improve the bussiness model and easily acess  this type of models in other places of word most of people like to travel . and most of the travelers find out that accomodation is the major problem during trips. and thats why i Take up this project to find out some insight how can people save there money through those platform .i start with looking this project and finding missing values and null values first i start clean this dataset then i start my analysis.\n",
        "i have soo many question soo i start with which location has most number of listing and and what are type of rooms there and on which location people willing to spend nights. Then i find out who is most popular host and if he is getting reviews or not. and distribution of price.and does latitudes and longitudes play a significant role in listing price. or  on which location people willing to spend more."
